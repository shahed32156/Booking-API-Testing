# Booking-API-Testing

API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a bridge that allows different software applications to talk to each other. I tested a Booking API with verious request(GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD and OPTIONS).

GET:- The GET method is used to retrieve data on a server. (I retrieved data from Booking API)
POST:- The POST method is used to create new resources. (I created data into Booking API with authorization token)
PUT:- The PUT method is used to replace an existing resource with an updated version. (I update or modify the existing data for perticular bookingid from Booking API with authorization token)
PATCH:- The PATCH method is used to update an existing resource. (I update or modify the existing single key value data for perticular bookingid from Booking API with authorization token)
DELETE:- The DELETE method is used to remove data from a database or API. (I delete the existing data for perticular bookingid from Booking API with authorization token)
HEAD:- The HEAD method is like a GET request, but it only retrieves the headers, not the response body. (I ensure by checking the API or URL is working fine or not)
OPTIONS:- The OPTIONS method is used to determine what HTTP methods are allowed for a particular resource. (I ensure by checking the GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE requests are allow and workin fine)

creating environments and creating global variables.
